# Suggested contributing workflow

## For a start
* Fork this project on Github.
* If you do not have an Apigee Edge trial organization please create a new one
[here](https://login.apigee.com/login).
* Register on https://travis-ci.org.
* Open https://travis-ci.org/[YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME]/apigee-edge-drupal and click
on "Activate repository".
* Open https://travis-ci.org/[YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME]/apigee-edge-drupal/settings
and setup required environment variables for running tests. (See the list of
required environment variables in the [Testing](#testing) section.)
* Install the module from for your fork instead of Drupal.org on your local. (See below.)

## For daily work
* Create a new branch in your fork repository, ex.: patch-1.
* Add changes to the code. If you implement new features please always add new
tests to cover the implemented functionality. If you modify existing features please always update related tests if needed.
* Push your changes to your repo's patch-1 branch.
* Wait until all Travis CI test jobs finish and _pass_.
* Create [new pull request](https://github.com/apigee/apigee-edge-drupal/pull/new/8.x-1.x)
and do not forget to add a link to Travis CI build that can confirm your code is working.

## Installing module from your fork instead of Drupal.org

Create a new branch on Github.com in your fork for your fix, ex.: patch-1.

Update your composer.json and install the module from your fork:
```bash
cd [DRUPAL_ROOT]
composer config repositories.forked-apigee_edge vcs https://github.com/[YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME]/apigee-edge-drupal
composer require drupal/apigee_edge:dev-patch-1 # It is important to require a branch/tag here that does not exist in the Drupal.org repo otherwise code gets pulled from there. For example, dev-8.x-1.x condition would pull the code from Drupal.org repo instead of your fork.  
```

If you would like to keep your fork always up-to-date with recent changes in
upstream then add Apigee repo as a remote (one time only):

```bash
cd [DRUPAL_ROOT]/modules/contrib/apigee_edge
git remote add upstream https://github.com/apigee/apigee-edge-drupal.git
git fetch upstream
```

For daily bases, rebase your current working branch to get latest changes from
upstream:

```bash
cd [DRUPAL_ROOT]/modules/contrib/apigee_edge
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/8.x-1.x
```

After you have installed the module from your fork you can easily create new
branches for new fixes on your local:
```bash
cd [DRUPAL_ROOT]/modules/contrib/apigee_edge
git fetch upstream
git checkout -b patch-2 upstream/8.x-1.x
## Add your awesome changes.
git push -u origin patch-2:patch-2 # Push changes to your repo.
## Create PR on Github.
``` 

## Running tests

Before you could start testing this module some environment variables
needs to be set on your system. These variables are:

* `APIGEE_EDGE_ENDPOINT`
* `APIGEE_EDGE_ORGANIZATION`
* `APIGEE_EDGE_USERNAME`
* `APIGEE_EDGE_PASSWORD`.

Value of `APIGEE_EDGE_USERNAME` should be an email address of an Apigee Edge user with **Organization administrator role** if you do not want to bump into permission issues in tests. Tests failed with "Forbidden" could be a sign of the insufficient permissions.

You can set these environment variables multiple ways, either by defining them
with `export` or `set` in the terminal or creating a copy of the `core/phpunit.xml.dist`
file as `core/phpunit.xml` and specifying them in that file.

After you have these environment variables set you can execute tests of this
module with the following command (note the location of the `phpunit` executable
may vary):

```sh
./vendor/bin/phpunit -c core --verbose --color --group apigee_edge
```

If you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system you can also run
PHPUnit tests with the following commands:

```bash
cd [DRUPAL_ROOT]/modules/contrib/apigee_edge/.travis
docker-compose up --build # Build is important because recent changes on module files have to be copied from the host to the container.
docker-compose run php /opt/drupal-module/.travis/run-test.sh # to run all tests of this module. This command performs some initial setup tasks if test environment has not been configured yet. 
docker-compose run php /opt/drupal-module/.travis/run-test.sh --filter testAppSettingsForm AppSettingsFormTest build/modules/contrib/apigee_edge/tests/src/FunctionalJavascript/AppSettingsFormTest.php # to run one specific test. If you pass any arguments to run-test.sh those get passed directly to PHPUnit. See [.travis/run-test.sh](run-test.sh).
docker-compose down --remove-orphans -v # Intermediate data (like module files) must be cleared from the shared volumes otherwise recent changes won't be visible in the container. 
```

You can read more about running Drupal 8 PHPUnit tests [here](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/phpunit/running-phpunit-tests).

### Troubleshooting

**If a test is passing on your local but it is failing on Travis CI.**
1. Try to restart failing job(s) one or two times, failing tests could be caused by communication issues.
2. If 1. did not work try to run the failing test(s) on your local in the above described
Docker based environment because this what Travis CI also uses for running tests.

## Best practices

## Accessing logs and browser outputs created by failed tests on Travis
You can access Drupal logs, browser outputs, and Apigee Edge module debug logs
created by tests if you set the following environment variables:
* LOGS_REPO_USER
* LOGS_REPO_PASSWORD
* LOGS_REPO_HOST
* LOGS_REPO_NAME

By using these environment variables Travis tries to push logs to this
repository URL:
`https://${LOGS_REPO_USER}:${LOGS_REPO_PASSWORD}@${LOGS_REPO_HOST}/${LOGS_REPO_USER}/${LOGS_REPO_NAME}.git`

### If your pull request relies on changes that are not yet available in Apigee Edge Client Library for PHP's latest stable release
Please *temporary* add required changes as patches to module's composer.json.
This way this module's tests could pass on Travis CI.

#### Example:

You can easily get a patch file from any Github pull requests by adding `.diff`
to end of the URL.

Pull request: https://github.com/apigee/apigee-client-php/pull/1
Patch file: https://github.com/apigee/apigee-client-php/pull/1.diff

composer.json:

```js
        "patches": {
            "apigee/apigee-client-php": {
                "Fix for a bug": "https://patch-diff.githubusercontent.com/raw/apigee/apigee-client-php/pull/1.diff"
            }
        }
```

**Note:** Apigee Client Library for PHP patches should be removed from the
module's composer.json before the next stable release. Code changes cannot be
merged until the related PR(s) have not been released in a new stable version of
the Apigee Client Library for PHP.
